Two types of components in React 

1 Satefull = able to manage a state or a data in all over the components
2. Stateless = you can pass a data from one to another in form of props but cannot manage in all over the components 


For funciton based components we use Hooks

synatx for Hooks
import {useState} from "React"
const [state,setState]=useState()
